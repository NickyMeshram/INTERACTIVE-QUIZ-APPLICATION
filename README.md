Task 1 – Quiz Application: Detailed Description

As part of my front-end development internship at The Code Tech, I successfully completed Task 1: building an interactive quiz application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project aimed to demonstrate my understanding of fundamental front-end technologies and my ability to create dynamic, user-focused web applications from scratch.

Tools and technologies used :-

1. HTML (HyperText Markup Language):
   I used HTML to build the basic structure of the web page. The main sections included a quiz title, a container to display the question, multiple-choice answer buttons, a result area to display feedback, and a "Next" button for navigation.

2. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):
   CSS was used to style the interface and improve the user experience. I applied custom styles to buttons, containers, fonts, and feedback states (such as highlighting correct or wrong answers). I also used CSS to make the layout responsive across different devices.

3. JavaScript:
   JavaScript handled the interactive logic. It allowed dynamic loading of questions, answer checking, immediate feedback to the user, score tracking, and conditional navigation between questions. The code was written using vanilla JavaScript without any external libraries.

4. Visual Studio Code:
   I used VS Code as my main code editor. Helpful extensions like Live Server were used for real-time previews, and Prettier was used for clean code formatting.

5. Git and GitHub:
   I used Git to manage version control and GitHub to host my code. All the code was committed and pushed to a public GitHub repository. This made it easy to track changes, collaborate, and submit the work professionally.

6. GitHub Pages:
   I used GitHub Pages to host the live version of the quiz app. This allowed mentors and team members to preview the working project directly in a browser without needing to download files or run code locally.

Application features :-

The quiz application includes multiple-choice questions stored in a JavaScript array. The user selects an answer, receives immediate feedback (correct or incorrect), and can move on to the next question. At the end of the quiz, the user sees their final score. The buttons are disabled after an answer is chosen to prevent multiple selections, and the correct answer is highlighted for learning. The interface is clean and responsive, making it easy to use on desktops and mobile devices.

Platforms used :-

The entire application was developed locally using VS Code and tested on Google Chrome. GitHub was used to host the source code and GitHub Pages for deployment. Live Server was used during development to preview the application in real-time, ensuring that all changes were visible immediately.

Real-world applications :-

This type of quiz app can be used in many real-world scenarios. For example, it could be integrated into an e-learning platform for assessments, a corporate training tool, or a simple interactive game on a website. It’s also useful in HR onboarding tests, online courses, or customer engagement quizzes. The app can easily be scaled or upgraded using frameworks like React or Vue, and data could be fetched from a real-time database or API for larger quizzes.

Conclusion :-

Building this quiz application gave me a strong understanding of how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together to create interactive web experiences. I learned how to structure code, manage logic flow, style UI elements, and deploy a live application. This task also gave me hands-on experience with Git and GitHub, which are essential tools in any developer's workflow. Overall, this project strengthened my core front-end development skills and taught me how to turn an idea into a working web application.
